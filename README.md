**Credit Risk Prediction**

<hr/>

# About the Repository

<hr/>

The repo contains the codebase for a machine learning prediction to calculate the expected loan status  for a customer given the basic information like person_age, person_income, person_home_ownership, person_emp_length, loan_intent, loan_grade, loan_amnt, loan_int_rate, loan_status, loan_percent_income, cb_person_default_on_file , cb_person_cred_hist_length.

# About the Project
<hr/>
As the name of the repo suggests this projects into a basic prediction model where given the various inputs, the model predicts what the expected status of loan for the customer/user can be.

# Learnings

After implementing the project it was seen that out of different algorithms ofXgboost, CatBoost,gradient boosting, Decision Trees and Random Forest (RF), RF provided the highest accuracy on the test data. Also, the difference between training and testing accuracy is very less. 

# Required packages
The codebase has been built with the following languages and tools:
<ol>
Python<ol>
<ol>NumPy<ol>
<ol>Pandas<ol>
<ol>Seaborn<ol>
<ol>Plotly<ol>
<ol>Pyspark<ol>
<ol>Scikit-learn<ol>
